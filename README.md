Customer Personality Analysis and Segmentation
 
A common issue in business is the lack of customer insight, which results in products that do not meet customer needs. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct customer personality analysis to better understand the customers and optimize marketing efforts that focus on relevant segments. K-Means Clustering is a machine learning algorithm used to group data into clusters based on similarities in their characteristics, helping to segment customers into distinct groups based on their attributes.
